A React library for natural asynchronous operations, and the best of the concurrent features' magic.

- Acessible: The aspiration is to spread the current and future, edgier features of React, by smoothing their user experience.
- Creative: It's not stuffed, but it's not boring, the idea is to bring features to attend interesting expectations related to real use cases and the usage of the APIs it's extending.
- Declarative: We extend React's fondness to declarative ness, and help them stick to it, since right now, by enable convenient (early) use of their awaited concurrent APIs.

## Getting started

_Requires React 16 or higher to work._

To get started you can install the `react-ergoasync` npm package, with:

```bash
npm install react-ergoasync
```

Or you can experiment with one of our playgrounds:

- [Our rewrite](https://codesandbox.io/s/elegant-panna-recz8u?file=/src/index.js) of [React's oficial Suspense for data fetching](https://17.reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-suspense.html#approach-3-render-as-you-fetch-using-suspense) 'Render-as-You-Fetch' [example](https://codesandbox.io/s/frosty-hermann-bztrp).
- [ReadablePromise with readAsync:](https://codesandbox.io/s/elated-haibt-c7u1cq) straight to it.
- [Suspense here:](https://codesandbox.io/s/angry-ganguly-9pgr1g?file=/src/index.js) humble but buffer.
- [useAwait demo:](https://codesandbox.io/s/sweet-mestorf-8ih8jk?file=/src/index.js) just like useState.
- [Suspending with useAwait](https://codesandbox.io/s/nifty-flower-49rppc?file=/src/index.js) for the sake of... You can.
